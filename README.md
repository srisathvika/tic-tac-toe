# tic-tac-toe
This is the java code for the game tic-tac-toe or x-o , both with and without GUI


The Java Tic Tac Toe game using GUI is a graphical user interface implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. The game board is represented as a 3x3 grid of buttons, which the player can click to place their mark (either "X" or "O"). The game uses Swing components to create the GUI, and it is built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, where the board state is maintained in the model, the GUI is the view, and the controller handles user interactions.

The game starts with an empty board, and players take turns placing their marks until one of them wins or the game ends in a draw. The game checks for a winner by checking each row, column, and diagonal for a set of three marks in a row. If a winner is found, a dialog box appears announcing the winner and the game ends. If no winner is found and the board is full, a dialog box appears announcing the draw and the game ends.

Overall, the Java Tic Tac Toe game using GUI is a simple yet fun implementation of the classic game, and it serves as a good example of how to use Java Swing components to create a graphical user interface for a game
